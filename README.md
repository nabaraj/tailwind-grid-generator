## Recommended IDE Setup

Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (disable Vetur for better compatibility).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TypeScript

Since TypeScript doesn’t natively support `.vue` imports, we replace `tsc` with `vue-tsc` for type checking. To enable proper TypeScript support in editors, install [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar).

## Customizing Configuration

For advanced configuration options, refer to the [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
